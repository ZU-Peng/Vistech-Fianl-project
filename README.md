This Data story uses data maps, focused on the violations of the Boston restaurant, trying to locate and analyze restaurant violations.

The Data set is Food Establishment Inspections - Datasets - Analyze Boston

To fulfill the storytelling, I used the methods below:
horizontal scroll telling: Use horizontal scroll telling to introduce the Title, and make it fly through a kitchen door.
magicaVoxel: Use magicaVoxel to build a 3D pixel display to decorate all the visual elements.
Data wrapper mapping: Use the Data wrapper to make five maps for the distribution of the restaurants.
Scrollama storytelling: Use Scrollama to fulfill the scroll telling, The map would change when the text is scrolling to a different part.
D3 Tooltips: Use D3 Tooltips to make a bar chart of the most violated regulations and pop up the frequency and the meaning of the regulations.
